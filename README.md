High Velocity is my Final Project for Year 1 of my Games Design course. It is an action parkour game where you must reach the end of the level without dying by using all the tools in your arsenal such as 3 different types of weapons each with unique behaviours, a shoulder-mounted rocket launcher to rocket jump around and a slow-motion ability for precision movements. Trying to stop you from reaching the end are stationary robots who have gone haywire and will attempt to shoot you to prevent you from  winning! There are also environmental hazards that can kill you such as Lava, Electricity and Crushers. The player must navigate through these obstacles without being hit to reach the end. 

The game features 2 levels, a tutorial where the player can learn the basic mechanics and a main level where they must fight their way to the end. There is also a main menu where the player can choose the level to play, quit the game and edit their settings. The settings are very customizable with the player being able to change their Sensitivity, Sniper Sensitivity, Field of View, Toggle Auto Sprint, Screen Shake Intensity and customize their keybinds for certain actions, all of which save in-between scenes and also between game sessions.
