High Velocity is my Final Project for Year 1 of my Games Design course. It is an action parkour game where you must reach the end of the level without dying by using all the tools in your arsenal such as 3 different types of weapons each with unique behaviours, a shoulder-mounted rocket launcher to rocket jump around and a slow-motion ability for precision movements. Trying to stop you from reaching the end are stationary robots who have gone haywire and will attempt to shoot you to prevent you from  winning! There are also environmental hazards that can kill you such as Lava, Electricity and Crushers. The player must navigate through these obstacles without being hit to reach the end. 

The game is very physics-based, with the player's movement being controller by a rigidbody and actions being able to propel the player and change their velocity. When enemies are killed they will also enable a physics ragdoll and fall to the ground in a random pose, these ragdolls can be pushed around and flung about using explosions. Some parts of the world are also destructible, there are certain props such as glass, tables and monitors which can be damaged in an explosion causing them to break apart and send their parts flying everywhere.

The player can also earn score for certain actions during the level and when the player reaches the end they will see their score for that level. The player can obtain score by killing enemies, completing the level quickly and killing enemies while moving fast, the faster you are moving when you kill an enemy the more score you get.

The game features 2 levels, a tutorial where the player can learn the basic mechanics and a main level where they must fight their way to the end. There is also a main menu where the player can choose the level to play, quit the game and edit their settings. The settings are very customizable with the player being able to change their Sensitivity, Sniper Sensitivity, Field of View, Toggle Auto Sprint, Screen Shake Intensity and customize their keybinds for certain actions, all of which save in-between scenes and also between game sessions.

In the first level the player must press 3 buttons to open a door which will lead them to the final room where they will fight to the end. These buttons are located in different places each with their own challenge.
